Team Nexxus : Problem Statement-2(HFB03)



Project Name: Ethereum Data Leasing with IPFS and React.

Overview:
This project demonstrates a decentralized data leasing system built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can lease their data securely using smart contracts, with data storage handled by IPFS. The front end is developed using React, providing a user-friendly interface, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The backend consists of smart contracts written in Solidity and a Node.js Express server for managing interactions with the blockchain.

Features
-->Lease data securely using Ethereum smart contracts.
-->Utilize IPFS for decentralized data storage.
-->Intuitive user interface developed with React.
-->Styling with Tailwind CSS for modern design.
-->Smart contracts written in Solidity for secure transactions.
-->Node.js Express server for backend logic and interaction with the blockchain.
-->Installation.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AbhignaGowda/HTFB03.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd project-directory
Install dependencies for the React front end:

npm install
Install dependencies for the Node.js Express backend:

cd backend
npm install

Usage
Start the React front end:

npm start
Start the Node.js Express backend:

cd backend
npm start

Configuration:
-->Ethereum Network: Ensure that you have configured your Ethereum network settings in the smart contract deployment scripts and backend server.
--->IPFS Node: Update the IPFS node configuration in the backend server for connecting to the IPFS network.
-->API Keys: If applicable, configure any API keys required for Ethereum or IPFS interactions.


Acknowledgements:
-->Ethereum for providing the blockchain platform.
-->IPFS for decentralized data storage.
-->React for the front end development.
-->Tailwind CSS for styling the user interface.
-->Solidity for writing smart contracts.
-->Node.js and Express for the backend server.
